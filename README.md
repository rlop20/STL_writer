# STL_writer
A C codebase that will write STL files, both text and binary, which can be loaded into any STL reader.

# How to use
Download all files and put them into the same directory. Compile the files by running 

make

into a terminal. Once compiled, you can run either the output.stl into any STL reading software such as Blender or viewstl.com.

# How to make custom shapes
Open and edit generator.c, there you can create a reference to the creator and call what shapes to use.
